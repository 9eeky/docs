Cost per thousand is a term used by marketers to indicate the price of 1,000 advertisement impressions on one webpage. If the owner of a website charges $3.00 CPM, an advertiser must pay $3.00 for every 1,000 impressions of their ad. The "M" in CPM stands for the word "mille," meaning "thousands" in Latin.

Marketers use CPM most commonly for pricing web ads. Marketers often measure how successful a CPM campaign is by its click-through rate.  An advertisement's success cannot be measured by CTR alone because a reader may view the ad, but not click on it and still be influenced by the advertisement.
