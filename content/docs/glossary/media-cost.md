The cost that is specifically spent on running an ad, as opposed to the costs of producing the copy or imagery for an ad. This includes the cost for any impressions, clicks, and activities.  Another term for "impression" in online advertising is a "page view". Page views or impressions are counted by the number of times a Web server responds to a  request from the user's browser. These requests are filtered to exclude robotic activity and error codes. Media cost for running ads on a website is generally calculated in Cost per Thousand, or CPM.
