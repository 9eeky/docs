### Basic Authentication with Two-Factor Authentication

Previously, customers with two-factor authentication enabled could utilize basic authentication over the SendGrid v2 API, v3 API, or SMTP. We have identified this as a misalignment between customersâ€™ expectations of security with 2FA and the authentication options permitted on their SendGrid accounts. In an abundance of caution, we have begun rejecting API calls using basic authentication if the user or subuser has two-factor authentication enabled. We recommend implementing API keys for your SendGrid API calls. If API key authentication is not possible, disable two-factor authentication from accounts which continue to use basic authentication and enable IP access management to improve security.
